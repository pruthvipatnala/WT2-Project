      <p>You cannot confuse this with "just another hill-station". Existing since several hundred centuries, Almora retains its charm
    rendered by its cobbled roads, carved wooden facades, spectacular scenic beauties and age-old temples. True it might, more than
    once, seem that time stands still here, especially when there is so much to discover in its bend and turns. Almora is almost
    always used as a stop-over point for excursions to nearby Binsar, Jageshwar and Bageshwar regions, which are frequented by
    adventure enthusiasts. And not to forget, this land is also credited to having beent he meditating spot for Swami Vivekananda.
    Visit Almora once at least to feel the cool and invigorating fresh air, enjoy Dusshera celebrations at the Nanda Devi Temple and
    hear interesting tales of how every neighbourhood got its name. but most of all, visit Almora to view one of the most
    unforgettable marvels of nature ever - that of the sun rising over the Great Himalayan Range...</p>
