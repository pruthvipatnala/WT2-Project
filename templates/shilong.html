      <p>Shillong or Scotland of the East is one of the most romantic cities in the northeast. And when you visit it, you'll just about
    know why. A relatively unexplored land, splendid visions of rows of pine trees, lush hills and quaint cottages greet you, all
    reminiscent of the British era gone by. The city derives its name from the 'Leishyllong', the super God who resides on the
    Shillong peak, as if protecting the city. There might not be much to do here except relax and soak in the legends that resound
    in every house. The polo ground almost wears a forlorn look minus the horses and forest conversation efforts have narrowed your
    chances of bagging an exquisite wooden ware. Nevertheless, Shillong abounds in such natural beauty that is definite to awe you.</p>
