      <p>Within the panoramic Kumaon region, lies the district of Nainital, a hill resort blessed with beauteous splendor. A favourite with the British, Nainital was, for a long time, home to Jim Corbett, and you would find mention of it in his books. Long ago, it probably housed just a handful of people. Today it is tourist-laden, that throng its Mall area, looking for activities or   simply to hang-out! And amidst all this glimmers the blue-green Naini Lake, reflecting in it silhouettes of mountains and trees.   Visit it whenever you want, but we recommend you give the tourist season a miss and visit it during the off-season. Because it is then that Nainital assumes its real splendor that made the British title it â€œhomeâ€ . And why not - its outskirts offer wondrous avenues for adventure enthusiasts, anglers and honeymooners. Trot on a pony, paddle out to the lake and bag yourself some of the most exotic candles you'd ever see. Let the peace of this resort envelop you!</p>

      <br><br>
      <p>
        Naina Devi Temple: Located at the north of the lake, this temple is dedicated to Naina Devi, a manifestation of Goddess
  Durga. It is believed that this is the spot where Goddess Sati's left eye fell, when Vishnu chopped her body to stop Shiva's
  cosmic dance of destruction. Also located close to the temple is the Naina Devi cave. <br><br>

  Naina Peak: 5 kms from the lake, the Naina Peak is the highest peak surrounding the lake. It is a popular picnic spot and
  affords marvellous views of the Himalayas, the Nanda Devi Peak and the mountains of the Tibetan border. <br><br>

  Other Lakes: Other than the Naini Lake, Nainital is also home to seven other picturesque lakes. Among these, Bhimtal is one of
  the most beautiful and popular. It has wonderful boating facilities and the island in the midst of it has a floating restaurant
  accessible only by boat! Saat Tal is an amalgamation of seven interconnected lakes and is set amidst dense oak and pine trees,
  home to migratory birds. Naukuchiatal or literally the nine-cornered lake is a good option for boating and fishing. A popular
  belief goes that if you visit all nine corners at one go, you are sure to attain Nirvana! Khurpatal, Harishtal, Lokhantal and
  Malwatal are also scenic spots known for very good angling options. <br><br>

  Boat House Club: Dating to the 19th century, visit the Boat House Club, which has a bar and billiards room facing the lake.
  Catch shimmering views of the city at night when millions of lights reflect on the lake. <br><br>

  Hanumangarhi: Located at an altitude of over 6000 ft near Tallital, Hanumangarhi has a temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman,
  who is depicted tearing his chest open to reveal Lord Ram and Goddess Sita. This high altitude also offers beautiful views
  of the sunset. Especially worthwhile is visiting it during the Ramnavami and Hanuman Jayanti Festivals. <br><br>

  Bara Bazaar & Snow View: Bara Bazaar is a vibrant market in Mallital. Its highlight is the ropeway or cable car, which
  leads to the Snow View. Located at an altitude of over 7000 ft, Snow View, on a clear day offers brilliant views of Nanda
  Devi, Trishul and Nanda Kot peaks.
  Open from: 10.00 am - 5.00 pm <br><br>

  Astronomical Observatory: Set up because of the clear skies here, the observatory is said to have one of the most advanced
  telescopes in India. This telescope is said to calculate the movement of stars, planets and other heavenly bodies extremely
  precisely. <br><br>

  Dorothy's Seat: Also known as Tiffin Top, it is located 4 kms west of the lake and offers somewhat spectacular views of
  Nainital. This seat was built by Kellet, an Englishman in memory of his wife, who died in an air crash. <br><br>

  Lands End: Located on the southern corner of the lake, Lands End offers panoramic views of Khurpa Tal. <br><br>

  Nainital Zoo: Located at a high-altitude, the Zoo is home to the rare Snow Leopard, steppe eagle and the Himalayan Black
  ear. The regal spotted owl is believed to emit a human voice if kept awake for 40 days.
  Open from: 10 am-4.30 pm, (except Monday) <br><br>

  Eco Cave Gardens: A naturally maintained park, this is a great place for children. The park has a musical fountain operating
  only in May and June. The six caves here are interesting to visit.
  Open from: 9.30 am-5.30 pm <br><br>

  Governor's House: The Raj Bhavan has gardens spread over 220 acres lined with deodar trees. The portico is designed in the shape
  of the British crown. The other memorabilia's worth watching are the magnanimous fireplace, the mailbox next to the writing table
  and conserÂ­vaÂ­tories called 'glass houses'. You can also try your hand at the 18-hole golf course at a fee of Rs 450.
  Open from: 11 am-5 pm. <br><br>

  St John Church in the Wilderness: Located in the thick of pine forests, the church is an ancient marvel, complete with stained   glass windows and old wooden pews. Dilapidated, but worth visiting is the old cemetery within its grounds, which is the resting
  place of the Britishers. <br><br>
